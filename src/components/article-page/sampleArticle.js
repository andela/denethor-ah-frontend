  "body": `<strong>Our original read time calculation was geared toward “slow” images, like comics, where you would really want to sit down and invest in the image. </strong>\n\nThis resulted in articles with crazy big read times. For instance, this article containing 140 images was clocking in at a whopping 87 minute read. So we amended our read time calculation to count 12 seconds for the first image, 11 for the second, and minus an additional second for each subsequent image. Any images after the tenth image are counted at three seconds.\n\n    You might see this change reflected across the site. Keep in mind that our estimated read time is just that: an estimation. You might finish a story faster or slower depending on various factors such as how many children or cats you have, your caffeine/alcohol intake, or if you’re a time-traveler from the future and already read that story. We just want to give you a ballpark figure so you can decide whether you have time to read one more story before the bus comes, or if you should bookmark it for later.\n\n<img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551632436-cbf8dd35adfa?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=751&q=80' alt='featured' />\n\n\nYou begin with a text, you sculpt information, you chisel away what's not needed, you come to the point, make things clear, add value, you're a content person, you like words. Design is no afterthought, far from it, but it comes in a deserved second. Anyway, you still use Lorem Ipsum and rightly so, as it will always have a place in the web workers toolbox, as things happen, not always the way you like it, not always in the preferred order. Even if your less into design and more into content strategy you may find some redeeming value with, wait for it, dummy copy, no less.\n\nConsider this: You made all the required mock ups for commissioned layout, got all the approvals, built a tested code base or had them built, you decided on a content management system, got a license for it or adapted open source software for your client's needs. Then the question arises: where's the content? Not there yet? That's not so bad, there's dummy copy to the rescue. But worse, what if the fish doesn't fit in the can, the foot's to big for the boot? Or to small? To short sentences, to many headings, images too large for the proposed design, or too small, or they fit in but it looks iffy for reasons the folks in the meeting can't quite tell right now, but they're unhappy, somehow. A client that's unhappy for a reason is a problem, a client that's unhappy though he or her can't quite put a finger on it is worse.\n\nBut. A big but: Lorem Ipsum is not t the root of the problem, it just shows what's going wrong. Chances are there wasn't collaboration, communication, and checkpoints, there wasn't a process agreed upon or specified with the granularity required. It's content strategy gone awry right from the start. Forswearing the use of Lorem Ipsum wouldn't have helped, won't help now. It's like saying you're a bad designer, use less bold text, don't use italics in every other paragraph. True enough, but that's not all that it takes to get things back on track.\n\nSo Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily)\n\nThere's lot of hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words in an old language. The villagers are out there with a vengeance to get that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks, wanting to tar and feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame.\n\nOne of the villagers, Kristina Halvorson from Adaptive Path, holds steadfastly to the notion that design can’t be tested without real content:\n\nI’ve heard the argument that “lorem ipsum” is effective in wireframing or design because it helps people focus on the actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we’re talking about creating a user experience that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS.\nIf that's what you think how bout the other way around? How can you evaluate content with`,
